For such systems, the cost and limitations of the hardware on sensing nodes prevent the use of range-based localization schemes that depend on absolute point-to-point distance estimates. Because coarse accuracy is sufficient for most sensor network applications, solutions in range-free localization are being pursued as a cost-effective alternative to more expensive range-based approaches. In this paper, we present APIT, a novel localization algorithm that is range-free. We show that our APIT scheme performs best when an irregular radio pattern and random node placement are considered, and low communication overhead is desired. We compare our work via extensive simulation, with three state-of-the-art range-free localization schemes to identify the preferable system configurations of each. In addition, we study the effect of location error on routing and tracking performance. We show that routing performance and tracking accuracy are not significantly affected by localization error when the error is less than 0.4 times the communication radio radius.","author":[{"name":"John Stankovic","id":"231"},{"name":"Brian M.

In this paper, we propose a differentiated surveillance service for sensor networks based on an adaptable energy-efficient sensing coverage protocol. In the protocol, each node is able to dynamically decide a schedule for itself to guarantee a certain degree of coverage (DOC) with average energy consumption inversely proportional to the node density. Several optimizations and extensions are proposed to provide even better performance. Simulation shows that our protocol accomplishes differentiated surveillance with low energy consumption. It outperforms other state-of-the-art schemes by as much as 50% reduction in energy consumption and as much as 130% increase in the half-life of the network.","author":[{"name":"John Stankovic","id":"231"},{"name":"Tian He","id":"365"},{"name":"Ting Yan","id":"413"}]},{"pub_id":"107","title":"Collaborative filtering with privacy via factor analysis","cite_count":"200","location":"Research and Development in Information Retrieval - SIGIR","pub_year":null,"ISBN":"10.1145\/564376.564419","abstract":"Collaborative filtering (CF) is valuable in e-commerce, and for direct recommendations for music, movies, news etc. But today's systems have several disadvantages, including privacy risks.

Privacy protection is provided by a peer-to-peer protocol which is described elsewhere, but outlined in this paper. The factor analysis approach handles missing data without requiring default values for them. We give several experiments that suggest that this is most accurate method for CF to date.

Vital to the success of wireless microsensor networks is the ability of microsensors to ``collectively perform sensing and computation''. In this paper, we study one of the fundamental challenges in sensor networks, node localization. The collaborative multilateration presented here, enables ad-hoc deployed sensor nodes to accurately estimate their locations by using known beacon locations that are several hops away and distance measurements to neighboring nodes. To prevent error accumulation in the network, node locations are computed by setting up and solving a global non-linear optimization problem. The solution is presented in two computation models, centralized and a fully distributed approximation of the centralized model. Our simulation results show that using the fully distributed model, resource constrained sensor nodes can collectively solve a large non-linear optimization problem that none of the nodes can solve individually. This approach results in significant savings in computation and communication, that allows fine-grained localization to run on a low cost sensor node we have developed.","author":[{"name":"Andreas Savvides","id":"100"},{"name":"Mani Srivastava","id":"225"}]},{"pub_id":"109","title":"SmartSkin: an infrastructure for freehand manipulation on interactive surfaces","cite_count":"265","location":"Computer Human Interaction - CHI","pub_year":null,"ISBN":"10.1145\/503376.503397","abstract":"This paper introduces a new sensor architecture for making interactive surfaces that are sensitive to human hand and finger gestures.

In this paper we describe TTDD, a Two-Tier Data Dissemination approach that provides scalable and efficient data delivery to multiple mobile sinks. Each data source in TTDD proactively builds a grid structure which enables mobile sinks to continuously receive data on the move by flooding queries within a local cell only.

We propose to model also the customer's network value: the expected profit from sales to other customers she may influence to buy, the customers those may influence, and so on recursively. Instead of viewing a market as a set of independent entities, we view it as a social network and model it as a Markov random field. We show the advantages of this approach using a social network mined from a collaborative filtering database.

The problem of localization, that is, determining where a given node is physically located in a network, is a challenging one, and yet extremely crucial for many of these applications. Practical considerations such as the small size, form factor, cost and power constraints of nodes preclude the reliance on GPS of all nodes in these networks. We review localization techniques and evaluate the effectiveness of a very simple connectivity metric method for localization in outdoor environments that makes use of the inherent RF communications capabilities of these devices. A fixed number of reference points in the network with overlapping regions of coverage transmit periodic beacon signals. Nodes use a simple connectivity metric, which is more robust to environmental vagaries, to infer proximity to a given subset of these reference points. Nodes localize themselves to the centroid of their proximate reference points. The accuracy of localization is then dependent on the separation distance between two-adjacent reference points and the transmission range of these reference points. Initial experimental results show that the accuracy for 90 percent of our data points is within one-third of the separation distance.

These systems, especially the k-nearest neighbor collaborative filtering based ones, are achieving widespread success on the Web. The tremendous growth in the amount of available information and the number of visitors to Web sites in recent years poses some key challenges for recommender systems. These are: producing high quality recommendations, performing many recommendations per second for millions of users and items and achieving high coverage in the face of data sparsity. In traditional collaborative filtering systems the amount of work increases with the number of participants in the system. New recommender system technologies are needed that can quickly produce high quality recommendations, even for very large-scale problems. To address these issues we have explored item-based collaborative filtering techniques. Item- based techniques first analyze the user-item matrix to identify relationships between different items, and then use these relationships to indirectly compute recommendations for users. In this paper we analyze different item-based recommendation generation algorithms. We look into different techniques for computing item-item similarities (e.g., item-item correlation vs. cosine similarities between item vec- tors) and different techniques for obtaining recommendations from them (e.g., weighted sum vs. regression model). Finally, we experimentally evaluate our results and compare them to the basic k-nearest neighbor approach. Our experiments suggest that item-based algorithms provide dramatically better performance than user-based algorithms, while at the same time providing better quality than the best available user-based algorithms.","author":[{"name":"Joseph Konstan","id":"30"},{"name":"Badrul M.

We present here SIMPLIcity (Semantics- sensitive Integrated Matching for Picture LIbraries), an image retrieval system, which uses semantics classification methods, a wavelet-based approach for feature extraction, and integrated region matching based upon image segmentation. As in other region- based retrieval systems, an image is represented by a set of regions, roughly corresponding to objects, which are characterized by color, texture, shape, and location. The system classifies images into semantic categories, such as textured-nontextured, graph-photograph. Potentially, the categorization enhances retrieval by permitting semantically-adaptive searching methods and narrowing down the searching range in a database. A measure for the overall similarity between images is developed using a region-matching scheme that integrates properties of all the regions in the images. Compared with retrieval based on individual regions, the overall similarity approach 1) reduces the adverse effect of inaccurate segmentation, 2) helps to clarify the semantics of a particular region, and 3) enables a simple querying interface for region-based image retrieval systems. The application of SIMPLIcity to several databases, including a database of about 200,000 general-purpose images, has demonstrated that our system performs significantly better and faster than existing ones. The system is fairly robust to image alterations.","author":[{"name":"Jia Li","id":"142"},{"name":"Gio Wiederhold","id":"289"},{"name":"James Ze Wang","id":"438"}]},{"pub_id":"134","title":"ICrafter: A Service Framework for Ubiquitous Computing Environments","cite_count":"200","location":"Ubiquitous Computing\/Handheld and Ubiquitous Computing - UbiComp(HUC)","pub_year":null,"ISBN":"10.1007\/3-540-45427-6_7","abstract":"In this paper, we propose ICrafter, a framework for services and their user interfaces in a class of ubiquitous computing environments.

Consequences of this perspective are the recognition that certain systems are not AOP and that some mechanisms are expressive enough to allow programming an AOP system within them. A corollary is that while AOP can be applied to Object-Oriented Programming, it is an independent concept applicable to other programming styles.","author":[{"name":"Robert E.

However, despite the benefits of context-awareness demonstrated in this prototype, widespread innovation of these capabilities is currently stifled by the difficulty in obtaining the contextual data.

The query image may be a hand-drawn sketch or a (potentially low-quality) scan of the image to be retrieved. Our searching algorithm makes use of multiresolution wavelet decompositions of the query and database images. The coefficients of these decompositions are distilled into small \"signatures\" for each image. We introduce an \"image querying metric\" that operates on these signatures. This metric essentially compares how many significant wavelet coefficients the query has in common with potential targets. The metric includes parameters that can be tuned, using a statistical analysis, to accommodate the kinds of image distortions found in different types of image queries. The resulting algorithm is simple, requires very little storage overhead for the database of signatures, and is fast enough to be performed on a database of 20,000 images at interactive rates (on standard desktop machines) as a query is sketched. Our experiments with hundreds of queries in databases of 1000 and 20,000 images show dramatic improvement, in both speed and success rate, over using a conventional L1, L2, or color histogram norm.","author":[{"name":"David Salesin","id":"20"},{"name":"Adam Finkelstein","id":"127"},{"name":"Charles E.

These tools take too much time to use and force designers to specify more of the design details than they wish at this early stage. Most interface designers, especially those who have a background in graphic design, prefer to sketch early interface ideas on paper or on a whiteboard. We are developing an interactive tool called SILK that allows designers to quickly sketch an interface using an electronic pad and stylus. SILK preserves the important properties of pencil and paper: a rough drawing can be produced very quickly and the medium is very flexible. However, unlike a paper sketch, this electronic sketch is interactive and can easily be modified. In addition, our system allows designers to examine, annotate, and edit a complete history of the design. When the designer is satisfied with this early prototype, SILK can transform the sketch into a complete, operational interface in a specified look-and-feel. This transformation is guided by the designer. By supporting the early phases of the interface design life cycle, our tool should both ease the development of user interface prototypes and reduce the time needed to create a final interface.

For the past decade, application-driven research on abiquitous computing (ubicomp) has pushed three interaction themes:natural interfaces, context-aware applications,and automated capture and access. To chart a course for future research in ubiquitous computing, we review the accomplishments of these efforts and point to remaining research challenges. Research in ubiquitious computing implicitly requires addressing some notion of scale, whether in the number and type of devices, the physical space of distributed computing, or the number of people using a system. We posit a new area of applications research, everyday computing, focussed on scaling interaction with respect to time. Just as pushing the availiability of computing away from the traditional desktop fundamentally changes the relationship between humans and computers, providing continuous interaction moves computing from a localized tool to a constant companion. Designing for continous interaction requires addressing interruption and reumption of intreaction, representing passages of time and providing associative storage models. Inherent in all of these interaction themes are difficult issues in the social implications of ubiquitous computing and the challenges of evaluating> ubiquitious computing research. Although cumulative experience points to lessons in privacy, security, visibility, and control, there are no simple guidelines for steering research efforts. Akin to any efforts involving new technologies, evaluation strategies form a spectrum from technology feasibility efforts to long-term use studies but a user-centric perspective is always possible and necessary","author":[{"name":"Elizabeth D.

Information filtering (IF) focuses on the analysis of item content and the development of a personal user interest profile. Collaborative filtering (CF) focuses on identification of other users with similar tastes and the use of their opinions to recommend items. Each technique has advantages and limitations that suggest that the two could be beneficially combined. This paper shows that a CF framework can be used to combine personal IF agents and the opinions of a community of users to produce better recommendations than either agents or users can produce alone. It also shows that using CF to create a personal combination of a set of agents produces better results than either individual agents or other combination mechanisms. One key implication of these results is that users can avoid having to select among agents; they can use them all and let the CF framework select the best ones for them.","author":[{"name":"Jonathan L.

We propose a representation for collaborative filtering tasks that allows the application of virtually any machine learning algorithm. We identify the shortcomings of current collaborative filtering techniques and propose the use of learning algorithms paired with feature extraction techniques that specifically address the limitations of previous approaches. Our best-performing algorithm is based on the singular value decomposition of an initial matrix of user ratings, exploiting latent structure that essentially eliminates the need for users to rate common items in order to become predictors for one another's preferences. We evaluate the proposed algorithm on a large database of user ratings for motion pictures and find that our approach significantly out- performs current collaborative filtering algorithms.","author":[{"name":"Daniel Billsus","id":"339"},{"name":"Michael Pazzani","id":"361"}]},{"pub_id":"163","title":"RADAR: An In-Building RF-based User Location and Tracking System","cite_count":"2507","location":"IEEE INFOCOM - INFOCOM","pub_year":null,"ISBN":"10.1109\/INFCOM.2000.832252","abstract":"The proliferation of mobile computing devices and local-area wireless networks has fostered a growing interest in location-aware systems and services.

Research on past tools has had enormous impact on today's developers virtually all applications today are built using some form of user interface tool. In this article, we consider cases of both success and failure in past user interface tools. From these cases we extract a set of themes which can serve as lessons for future work. Using these themes, past tools can be characterized by what aspects of the user interface they addressed, their threshold and ceiling, what path of least resistance they offer, how predictable they are to use, and whether they addressed a target that became irrelevant. We believe the lessons of these past themes are particularly important now, because increasingly rapid technological changes are likely to significantly change user interfaces. We are at the dawn of an era where user interfaces are about to break out of the \"desktop\" box where they have been stuck for the past 15 years. The next millenium will open with an increasing diversity of user interface on an increasing diversity of computerized devices. These devices include hand-held personal digital assistants (PDAs), cell phones, pages, computerized pens, computerized notepads, and various kinds of desk and wall size-computers, as well as devices in everyday objects (such as mounted on refridgerators, or even embedded in truck tires). The increased connectivity of computers, initially evidenced by the World Wide Web, but spreading also with technologies such as personal-area networks, will also have a profound effect on the user interface to computers. Another important force will be recognition-based user interfaces, especially speech, and camera-based vision systems. Other changes we see are an increasing need for 3D and end-user customization, programming, and scripting. All of these changes will require significant support from the underlying user interface sofware tools.","author":[{"name":"Brad A. Myers","id":"53"},{"name":"Scott E.

Traditional clustering algorithms either favor clusters with spherical shapes and similar sizes, or are very fragile in the presence of outliers. We propose a new clustering algorithm called CURE that is more robust to outliers, and identifies clusters having non-spherical shapes and wide variances in size. CURE achieves this by representing each cluster by a certain fixed number of points that are generated by selecting well scattered points from the cluster and then shrinking them toward the center of the cluster by a specified fraction. Having more than one representative point per cluster allows CURE to adjust well to the geometry of non-spherical shapes and the shrinking helps to dampen the effects of outliers. To handle large databases, CURE employs a combination of random sampling and partitioning. A random sample drawn from the data set is first partitioned and each partition is partially clustered. The partial clusters are then clustered in a second pass to yield the desired clusters. Our experimental results confirm that the quality of clusters produced by CURE is much better than those found by existing algorithms. Furthermore, they demonstrate that random sampling and partitioning enable CURE to not only outperform existing algorithms but also to scale well for large databases without sacrificing clustering quality.","author":[{"name":"Kyuseok Shim ()","id":"4"},{"name":"Rajeev Rastogi","id":"70"},{"name":"Sudipto Guha","id":"85"}]},{"pub_id":"171","title":"World-Wide Web: The Information Universe","cite_count":"417","location":"Electronic Networking: Research, Applications and Policy - EN","pub_year":null,"ISBN":"10.1108\/eb047254","abstract":"The World-Wide Web (W3) initiative is a practical project to bring a global information universe into existence using available technology.

Usability problems that relate to missing interface elements that ought to be introduced were more difficult to find by heuristic evaluation in interfaces implemented as paper prototypes but were as easy as other problems to find in running systems.","author":[{"name":"Jakob Nielsen","id":"364"}]},{"pub_id":"188","title":"Augmented surfaces: a spatially continuous work space for hybrid computing environments","cite_count":"373","location":"Computer Human Interaction - CHI","pub_year":null,"ISBN":"10.1145\/302979.303113","abstract":"This paper describes our design and implementation of a computer augmented environment that allows users to smoothly interchange digital information among their portable computers, table and wall displays, and other physical objects.

Unfortunately, this ability to convey ideas does not transfer well to humans interacting with computers. In traditional interactive computing, users have an impoverished mechanism for providing input to computers. By improving the computer's access to context, we increase the richness of communication in human-computer interaction and make it possible to produce more useful computational services. The use of context is increasingly important in the fields of handheld and ubiquitous computing, where the user's context is changing rapidly. In this panel, we want to discuss some of the research challenges in understanding context and in developing context-aware applications. We define context as any information that can be used to characterize the situation of an entity, where an entity can be a person, place, or physical or computational object. We define context-awareness or context-aware computing as the use of con-text to provide task-relevant information and\/or services to a user. Three important context-awareness behaviours are the presentation of information and services to a user, automatic execution of a service, and tagging of context to information for later retrieval.

We present a unified framework for virtual-environment interaction based on proprioception, a person's sense of the position and orientation of his body and limbs. We describe three forms of body-relative interaction: Direct manipulation ways to use body sense to help control manipulation Physical mnemonics ways to store\/recall information relative to the body Gestural actions ways to use body-relative actions to is- sue commands Automatic scaling is a way to bring objects instantly within reach so that users can manipulate them using proprioceptive cues. Several novel virtual interaction techniques based upon automatic scaling and our proposed framework of proprioception allow a user to interact with a virtual world intuitively, efficiently, precisely, and lazily.

However, this potential requires development of viewpoint movement techniques that support rapid and controlled movement through workspaces. Rapid movement through large distances avoids wasted work time; controlled movement near target objects allows the user to examine and interact with objects in the workspace. Current techniques for viewpoint movement typically use high velocities to cover distances rapidly, but high velocities are hard to control near objects. This paper describes a new technique for targeted viewpoint movement that solves this problem. The key idea is to have the user indicate a point of interest (target) on a 3D object and use the distance to this target to move the viewpoint logarithmically, by moving the same relative percentage of distance to the target on every animation cycle. the result is rapid motion over distances that slows as the viewpoint approaches the target object. The technique can be used with 2D and multidimensional input devices. We also extend the technique to move objects in the workspace.","author":[{"name":"George Robertson","id":"120"},{"name":"Jock Mackinlay","id":"148"},{"name":"Stuart K.

The design of systems and applications in these environments needs to take account of heterogeneous devices, mobile users and rapidly changing contexts. Most importantly, agents in ubiquitous and mobile environments need to be context-aware so that they can adapt themselves to different situations. In this paper, we argue that ubiquitous computing environments must provide middleware support for context-awareness. We also pro- pose a middleware that facilitates the development of context-aware agents. The middleware allows agents to acquire contextual information easily, reason about it using different logics and then adapt themselves to changing contexts. An- other key issue in these environments is allowing autonomous, heterogeneous agents to have a common semantic understanding of contextual information. Our middleware tackles this problem by using ontologies to define different types of contextual information. This middleware is part of Gaia, our infrastructure for enabling Smart Spaces.","author":[{"name":"Anand Ranganathan","id":"32"},{"name":"Roy Harold Campbell","id":"185"}]},{"pub_id":"202","title":"The anatomy of a context-aware application","cite_count":"637","location":"Mobile Computing and Networking - MOBICOM","pub_year":null,"ISBN":"10.1145\/313451.313476","abstract":"Abstract We describe a platform for context-aware computing,which enables applications to follow mobile,users as they move around,a building.

The algorithm is based on multidimensional scaling, a data analysis technique that takes O(n3) time for a network of n nodes.

Furthermore, it can achieve comparable results using many fewer anchor nodes than previous methods, and even yields relative coordinates when no anchor nodes are available.","author":[{"name":"Markus P.

The most unique phenotypic feature visible in a person's face is the detailed texture of each eye's iris: An estimate of its statistical complexity in a sample of the human population reveals variation corresponding to several hundred independent degrees-of-freedom. Morphogenetic randomness in the texture expressed phenotypically in the iris trabecular meshwork ensures that a test of statistical independence on two coded patterns originating from different eyes is passed almost certainly, whereas the same test is failed almost certainly when the compared codes originate from the same eye. The visible texture of a person's iris in a real-time video image is encoded into a compact sequence of multi-scale quadrature 2-D Gabor wavelet coefficients, whose most-significant bits comprise a 256-byte \"iris code.\" Statistical decision theory generates identification decisions from Exclusive- OR comparisons of complete iris codes at the rate of 4000 per second, including calculation of decision confidence levels. The distributions observed empirically in such comparisons imply a theoretical \"cross-over\" error rate of one in 131000 when a decision criterion is adopted that would equalize the false accept and false reject error rates.

However, cognitive walkthrough, heuristic evaluation, and thinking-aloud studies - three of the most widely used UEMs - suffer from a substantial evaluator effect in that multiple evaluators evaluating the same interface with the same UEM detect markedly different sets of problems. A review of eleven studies of these three UEMs reveals that the evaluator effect exists for both novice and experienced evaluators, for both cosmetic and severe problems, for both problem detection and severity assessment, and for evaluations of both simple and complex systems. The average agreement between any two evaluators who have evaluated the same system using the same UEM ranges from 5% to 65%, and no one of the three UEMs is consistently better than the others. While evaluator effects of this magnitude may not be surprising for a UEM as informal as heuristic evaluation, it is certainly notable that a substantial evaluator effect persists for evaluators who apply the strict procedure of cognitive walkthrough or observe users thinking out loud. Hence, it is highly questionable to use a thinking -aloud study with one evaluator as an authoritative statement about what problems an interface contains. Generally, the application of the UEMs is characterised by (1) vague goal analyses leading to variability in the task scenarios, (2) vague evaluation procedures leading to anchoring, and\/or (3) vague problem criteria leading to anything being accepted as a usability problem. The simplest way of coping with the evaluator effect, which cannot be completely eliminated, is to involve multiple evaluators in usability evaluations.","author":[{"name":"Morten Hertzum","id":"118"},{"name":"Niels Ebbe Jacobsen","id":"228"}]},{"pub_id":"231","title":"How people revisit web pages: empirical findings and implications for the design of history systems","cite_count":"366","location":"International Journal of Human-computer Studies \/ International Journal of Man-machine Studies - IJMMS","pub_year":null,"ISBN":"10.1006\/ijhc.1997.0125","abstract":"We report on users' revisitation patterns to World Wide Web (web) pages, and use the results to lay an empirical foundation for the design of history mechanisms in web browsers. Through history, a user can return quickly to a previously visited page, possibly reducing the cognitive and physical overhead required to navigate to it from scratch. We analysed 6 weeks of detailed usage data collected from 23 users of a well- known web browser. We found that 58% of an individual's pages are revisits, and that users continually add new web pages into their repertoire of visited pages. People tend to revisit pages just visited, access only a few pages frequently, browse in very small clusters of related pages and generate only short sequences of repeated URL paths. We compared dierent history mechanisms, and found that the stack-based prediction method prevalent in commercial browsers is inferior to the simpler approach of showing the last few recently visited URLs with duplicates removed. Other predictive approaches fare even better. Based on empirical evidence, eight design guidelines for web browser history mechanisms were then formulated. When used to evaluate the existing hypertext-based history mechanisms, they explain why some aspects of today's browsers seem to work well, and other's poorly. The guidelines also indicate how history mechanisms in the web can be made even more eective.

The Tic-Tac-Toe and its isomorphs are used to illustrate the procedures of the framework as a methodology and test the predictions of the framework as a functional model. Experimental results show that the behavior in the Tic-Tac-Toe is determined by the directly available information in external and internal representations in terms of perceptual and cognitive biases, regardless of whether the biases are consistent with, inconsistent with, or irrelevant to the task. It is shown that external representations are not merely inputs and stimuli to the internal mind and that they have much more important functions than mere memory aids. A representational determinism is suggested--the form of a representation determines what information can be perceived, what processes can be activated, and what structures can be discovered from the specific representation. External representations are involved in many cognitive tasks, such as multiplication with paper and pencil, grocery shopping with a written list, geometrical problem solving, graph understanding, diagrammatic reasoning, chess playing, and so on. Few would deny that external representations play certain roles in these tasks. However, in comparison with internal representations, relatively little research has been directed towards the nature of external representations in cognition. This might be due to the belief that very little knowledge about the internal mind can be gained by studying external representations, or due to the view that external representations are nothing but inputs and stimuli to the internal mind, or simply due to the lack of a suitable methodology for studying external representations. This article explores the functions of external representations, using problem solving as the task domain and test bed. It takes the position that much can be learned about the internal mind by studying external representations because much of the structure of the internal mind is a reflection of the structure of the external environment (e.g., Anderson, 1993; Shepard, 1984; Simon, 1981). It argues that external representations are not simply inputs and stimuli to the internal mind; rather, they are so intrinsic to many cognitive tasks that they guide, constrain, and even determine cognitive behavior. By focusing on what information in external representations can be perceived and how the information in external representations affects problem solving behavior, this article develops a theoretical framework for external representation based (henceforth, ER-based) problem solving. This framework is not only a functional model that can make specific empirical predictions but also a methodology that can be used to systematically analyze ER-based problem solving tasks. This article is divided into five parts. The first part introduces the theoretical background, including a definition of external representations, a discussion on the relationship between internal and external representations, and a brief review of the important roles of external representations in cognition. The second part proposes the theoretical framework for ER-based problem solving. The third part uses the framework as a methodology to analyze the structure of the Tic- Tac-Toe and as a functional model to make specific predictions about the behavior in the Tic-Tac-Toe. The fourth part reports three experiments designed to test the predictions of the framework and examine the general properties of external representations. The last part summarizes the experimental results, evalu- ates the theoretical framework, and suggests a representational determinism.","author":[{"name":"Jia-jie Zhang","id":"202"}]},{"pub_id":"234","title":"Representations in Distributed Cognitive Tasks","cite_count":"447","location":"Cognitive Science - COGSCI","pub_year":null,"ISBN":"10.1207\/s15516709cog1801_3","abstract":"In this paper we propose a theoretical frame- work of distributed representations and a methodology of representational analysis for the study of distributed cognitive tasks tasks that require the processing of information distributed across the internal mind and the external environment. The basic principle of distributed representations is that the representational system of a distributed cognitive task is a set of internal and external representations, which together represent the abstract structure of the task. The basic strategy of representational analysis is to decompose the representation of a hierarchical task into its component levels so that the representational properties at each level can be independently examined. The theoretical framework and the methodology are used to analyze the hi- erarchical structure of the Tower of Hanoi problem. Based on this analysis, four experiments are designed to examine the representational proper- ties of the Tower of Hanoi.

This raises a new design challenge for HCI - how should spectators experience a performer's interaction with a computer? We classify public interfaces (including examples from art, performance and exhibition design) according to the extent to which a performer's manipulations of an interface and their resulting effects are hidden, partially revealed, fully revealed or even amplified for spectators. Our taxonomy uncovers four broad design strategies: 'secretive,' where manipulations and effects are largely hidden; 'expressive,' where they tend to be revealed enabling the spectator to fully appreciate the performer's interaction; 'magical,' where effects are revealed but the manipulations that caused them are hidden; and finally 'suspenseful,' where manipulations are apparent but effects are only revealed as the spectator takes their turn.","author":[{"name":"Claire O'malley","id":"17"},{"name":"Mike Fraser","id":"126"},{"name":"Stuart Reeves","id":"323"},{"name":"Steve Benford","id":"369"}]},{"pub_id":"251","title":"Localization for mobile sensor networks","cite_count":"392","location":"Mobile Computing and Networking - MOBICOM","pub_year":null,"ISBN":"10.1145\/1023720.1023726","abstract":"Many sensor network applications require location awareness, but it is often too expensive to include a GPS receiver in a sensor network node. Hence, localization schemes for sensor networks typically use a small number of seed nodes that know their location and protocols whereby other nodes estimate their location from the messages they receive. Several such localization techniques have been proposed, but none of them consider mobile nodes and seeds. Although mobility would appear to make localization more difficult, in this paper we introduce the sequential Monte Carlo Localization method and argue that it can exploit mobility to improve the accuracy and precision of localization. Our approach does not require additional hardware on the nodes and works even when the movement of seeds and nodes is uncontrollable. We analyze the properties of our technique and report experimental results from simulations. Our scheme outperforms the best known static localization schemes under a wide range of conditions.","author":[{"name":"David Evans","id":"376"},{"name":"Lingxuan Hu","id":"418"}]},{"pub_id":"252","title":"Improving recommendation lists through topic diversification","cite_count":"193","location":"World Wide Web Conference Series - WWW","pub_year":null,"ISBN":"10.1145\/1060745.1060754","abstract":"In this work we present topic diversification, a novel method designed to balance and diversify personalized recommendation lists in order to reflect the user's complete spectrum of interests.

Not only is this true for general purpose computation on personal computers and workstations, but also for portable devices, application-specific systems etc. In fact, firmware and embedded software executing on RISC and DSP processor cores that are embedded in ASIC's has emerged as a leading implementation methodology for speech coding, modem functionality, video compression, communication protocol processing etc. This paper describes architectural techniques for energy efficient implementation of programmable computation, particularly focussing on the computation needed in portable devices where event-driven user interfaces, communication protocols, and signal processing play a dominant role. Two key approaches described here are predictive system shutdown and extended voltage scaling.

The algorithms which will be examined are the spatial gray level dependence method (SGLDM), the gray level run length method (GLRLM), the gray level difference method (GLDM), and the power spectral method (PSM). The evaluation procedure employed does not depend on the set of features used with each algorithm or the pattern recognition scheme. Rather, what is examined is the amount of texture context information contained in the spatial gray level dependence matrices, the gray level run length matrices, the gray level difference density functions, and the power spectrum. The comparison will be performed in two steps. First, only Markov generated textures will be considered. The Markov textures employed are similar to the ones used by perceptual psychologist B. Julesz in his investigations of human texture perception. These Markov textures provide a convenient mechanism for generating certain example texture pairs which are important in the analysis process. In the second part of the analysis the results obtained by considering only Markov textures will be extended to all textures which can be represented by translation stationary random fields of order two. This generalization clearly includes a much broader class of textures than Markovian ones. The results obtained indicate that the SGLDM is the most powerful algorithm of the four considered, and that the GLDM is more powerful than the PSM.","author":[{"name":"Charles A.

MDS-MAP is a recent localization method based on multidimentional scaling (MDS). It uses connectivity information who is within communications range of whomto derive the locations of the nodes in the network, and can take advantage of additional data, such as estimated distances between neighbors or known positions for certain anchor nodes, if they are available. However, MDS- MAP is an inherently centralized algorithm and is there- fore of limited utility in many applications. In this paper, we present a new variant of the MDS-MAP method, which we call patched MDS-MAP, that can easily be executed in a distributed fashion. Using extensive simulations, we show that the new algorithm not only preserves the good performance of original method on relatively uniform layouts, but also performs much better than the original on irregularly- shaped networks. The main idea is to build a local map at each node of the immediate vicinity and then merge these maps together to form a global map. This approach works much better for topologies in which the shortest path distance between two nodes does not correspond well to their Euclidean distance. We also discuss an optional refinement step that improves solution quality even further at the expense of additional computation.","author":[{"name":"Wheeler Ruml","id":"33"},{"name":"Yi Shang ()","id":"50"}]},{"pub_id":"284","title":"Dimensional overlap: Cognitive basis for stimulus-response compatibility--A model and taxonomy","cite_count":"602","location":"Psychological Review - PSYCHOL REV","pub_year":null,"ISBN":"10.1037\/\/0033-295X.97.2.253","abstract":"In this article, we address the classic problem of stimulus- response (S-R) compatibility (SRC). A model is proposed that attempts to provide a systematic account of performance in highly compatible, incompatible, and noncompatible tasks. At the core of our model is the idea that when a particular S-R ensemble produces either high or low compatibility effects, it is because the stimulus and response sets in the ensemble have properties in common, and elements in the stimulus set automatically activate corresponding elements in the response set. Noncompatible tasks are those in which the stimulus and response sets have nothing in common. If the activated response is the required one, it will be executed rapidly and correctly; if it is not, then it will be relatively slow and error prone. Whether a particular S-R ensemble will produce compatibility effects is often quite easy to determine because of the relationship be- tween the stimulus and response sets. In the part of the model that treats the representational aspects of the problem, we postulate that this relationship is based on the commonality, similarity, or correspondence of the sets in the ensemble. We call this the dimensional overlap of the ensemble. The automatic response activation mechanisms, as well as the response identification processes underlying SRC effects, are the processing aspect of the model. Even though the model is still in its qualitative development phase, it is able to make ordinal predictions concerning several different SRC effects, such as the effects of mapping, irrelevant dimensions, and number of alternatives. These effects had been viewed as unrelated empirical phenomena, and most of the work on SRC has dealt with them as manifestations of unique, nongeneralizable properties of particular dimensions or specific tasks. This approach has led to different accounts being proposed for \"spatial,\" \"symbolic,\" \"sensori-motor;' and \"semantic\" tasks. Our model attempts to break with such past approaches in a fundamental way by proposing to account for most major SRC effects in terms of common basic cognitive mechanisms. This unitary approach leads to a taxonomy of SRC tasks that reveals striking similarities be- tween them and suggestive parallels with the experimental paradigms that have traditionally been used to investigate attentional, controlled, and automatic processes.","author":[{"name":"Thierry Hasbroucq","id":"167"},{"name":"Allen M.

The concepts of toolkits and widget libraries in graphical user interfaces has been tremendously successful, allowing programmers to leverage off existing building blocks to build interactive systems more easily.We introduce the concept of context widgets that mediate betweenthe environment and the application in the same way graphical widgets mediate between the user and the application. We illustrate the concept of context widgets with the beginnings of a widget library we have developed for sensing presence, identity and activity of people and things. We assess the success of our approach with two example context-enabled applications we have built and an existing application to which we have added context-sensing capabilities.","author":[{"name":"Daniel Salber","id":"110"},{"name":"Gregory D.

We find that networks in these communities typically differ in their topology from other online networks such as the World Wide Web. Systems targeted to augment web-based communities by automatically identifying users with expertise, for example, need to adapt to the underlying interaction dynamics. In this study, we analyze the Java Forum, a large online help-seeking community, using social network analysis methods. We test a set of network-based ranking algorithms, including PageRank and HITS, on this large size social network in order to identify users with high expertise. We then use simulations to identify a small number of simple simulation rules governing the question-answer dynamic in the network. These simple rules not only replicate the structural characteristics and algorithm performance on the empirically observed Java Forum, but also allow us to evaluate how other algorithms may perform in communities with different characteristics. We believe this approach will be fruitful for practical algorithm design and implementation for online expertise-sharing communities.","author":[{"name":"Mark S.

It is based on a Markov-chain model of random walk through the database. More precisely, we compute quantities (the average commute time, the pseudoinverse of the Laplacian matrix of the graph, etc.) that provide similarities between any pair of nodes, having the nice property of increasing when the number of paths connecting those elements increases and when the \"length\" of paths decreases. It turns out that the square root of the average commute time is a Euclidean distance and that the pseudoinverse of the Laplacian matrix is a kernel matrix (its elements are inner products closely related to commute times). A principal component analysis (PCA) of the graph is introduced for computing the subspace projection of the node vectors in a manner that preserves as much variance as possible in terms of the Euclidean commute-time distance. This graph PCA provides a nice interpretation to the \"Fiedler vector,\" widely used for graph partitioning. The model is evaluated on a collaborative- recommendation task where suggestions are made about which movies people should watch based upon what they watched in the past. Experimental results on the MovieLens database show that the Laplacian-based similarities perform well in comparison with other methods. The model, which nicely fits into the so-called \"statistical relational learning\" framework, could also be used to compute document or word similarities, and, more generally, it could be applied to machine-learning and pattern-recognition tasks involving a relational database.","author":[{"name":"Jean-michel Renders","id":"88"},{"name":"Alain Pirotte","id":"182"},{"name":"Marco Saerens","id":"259"},{"name":"Francois Fouss (Franois Fouss)","id":"389"}]},{"pub_id":"294","title":"Features for image retrieval: an experimental comparison","cite_count":"66","location":"Information Retrieval - IR","pub_year":null,"ISBN":"10.1007\/s10791-007-9039-3","abstract":"An experimental comparison of a large number of different image descriptors for content-based image retrieval is presented. Many of the papers describing new techniques and descriptors for content-based image retrieval describe their newly proposed methods as most appropriate without giving an in-depth comparison with all methods that were proposed earlier. In this paper , we first give an overview of a large variety of features for content-based image retrieval and compare them quantitatively on four different tasks: stock photo retrieval, personal photo collection retrieval, building retrieval, and medical image retrieval. For the experiments, five different, publicly available image databases are used and the retrieval performance of the features is analysed in detail. This allows for a direct comparison of all features considered in this work and furthermore will allow a comparison of newly proposed features to these in the future. Additionally, the correlation of the features is analysed, which opens the way for a simple and intuitive method to find an initial set of suitable features for a new task. The article concludes with recommendations which features perform well for what type of data. Interestingly, the often used, but very simple, colour histogram performs well in the comparison and thus can be recommended as a simple baseline for many applications.","author":[{"name":"Daniel Keysers","id":"47"},{"name":"Thomas Deselaers","id":"49"},{"name":"Hermann Ney","id":"222"}]},{"pub_id":"295","title":"A survey on context-aware systems","cite_count":"353","location":"International Journal of Ad Hoc and Ubiquitous Computing - IJAHUC","pub_year":null,"ISBN":"10.1504\/IJAHUC.2007.014070","abstract":"Abstract:Context-aware systems offer entirely new,opportunities for application developers and for end users by gathering,context data and adapting systems behaviour accordingly.

We describe an accurate vision-based tracking method for table-top AR environments and tangible user interface (TUI) techniques based on this method that allow users to manipulate virtual objects in a natural and intuitive manner. Our approach is robust, allowing users to cover some of the tracking markers while still returning camera viewpoint information, overcoming one of the limitations of traditional computer vision based systems.
