For such systems, the cost and limitations of the hardware on sensing nodes prevent the use of range-based localization schemes that depend on absolute point-to-point distance estimates. Because coarse accuracy is sufficient for most sensor network  applications, solutions in range-free localization are being pursued as a cost-effective alternative to more expensive range-based approaches. In this paper, we present APIT, a novel localization algorithm that is range-free. We show that our APIT scheme performs best when an irregular radio pattern and random node placement are considered, and low communication overhead is desired. We compare our work via extensive simulation, with three state-of-the-art range-free localization schemes to identify the preferable system configurations of each. In addition, we study the effect of location error on routing and tracking performance. We show that routing performance and tracking accuracy are not significantly affected by localization error when the error is less than 0.4 times the communication radio radius.', 'Mobile Computing and Networking - MOBICOM'),

The platform builds a dynamic model  of the environment using these location sensors and resource information gathered by telemetry software, and presents it in a form suitable for application programmers. Use of the platform is illustrated through a practical example, which allows a user''s current working desktop to follow them as they move around the environment.', 'Wireless Networks - WINET'),

It is also preferable for the sensor network  to provide differentiated surveillance service for various target areas with different degrees of security requirements. In this paper, we propose a differentiated surveillance service for sensor networks based on an adaptable energy-efficient sensing coverage protocol. In the protocol, each node is able to dynamically decide a schedule for itself to guarantee a certain degree of coverage (DOC) with average energy consumption  inversely proportional to the node density. Several optimizations and extensions are proposed to provide even better performance. Simulation shows that our protocol accomplishes differentiated surveillance with low energy  consumption. It outperforms other state-of-the-art schemes by as much as 50% reduction in energy consumption  and as much as 130% increase in the half-life of the network.', 'Conference On Embedded Networked Sensor Systems - SenSys'),

As we move toward ubiquitous computing, there is a great potential for individuals to share all kinds of information about places and things to do, see and buy, but the privacy risks are severe. In this paper we describe a new method for collaborative filtering  which protects the privacy of individual data. The method is based on a probabilistic factor analysis  model. Privacy protection  is provided by a peer-to-peer protocol which is described elsewhere, but outlined in this paper. The factor analysis  approach handles missing data  without requiring default values for them. We give several experiments that suggest that this is most accurate method for CF to date.

Vital to the success of wireless microsensor networks is the ability of microsensors to ``collectively perform sensing and computation''''. In this paper, we study one of the fundamental challenges in sensor networks, node localization. The collaborative multilateration presented here, enables ad-hoc deployed sensor nodes  to accurately estimate their locations by using known beacon locations that are several hops away and distance measurements to neighboring nodes. To prevent error accumulation in the network, node locations are computed by setting up and solving a global non-linear optimization  problem. The solution is presented in two computation models, centralized and a fully distributed approximation of the centralized model. Our simulation results show that using the fully distributed model, resource constrained sensor nodes  can collectively solve a large non-linear optimization  problem that none of the nodes can solve individually. This approach results in significant savings in computation and communication, that allows fine-grained localization to run on a low cost sensor node we have developed.', 'Mobile Computing and Networking - MOBICOM'),

This paper describes the design, implementation and analysis of a system for determining position inside a building from measured RF signal strengths of packets on an IEEE 802.11b wireless Ethernet network. Previous approaches to location awareness  with RF signals have been severely hampered by non-linearity, noise and complex correlations due to multi-path effects, interference and absorption. The design of our system begins with the observation that determining position from complex, noisy and non-linear signals is a well-studied problem in the field of robotics. Using only off-the-shelf hardware, we achieve robust position estimation  to within a meter in our experimental context and after adequate training of our system. We can also coarsely determine our orientation and can track our position as we move. By applying recent advances in probabilistic inference  of position and sensor fusion  from noisy signals, we show that the RF emissions from base stations as measured by off-the-shelf wireless Ethernet cards are sufficiently rich in information to permit a mobile device  to reliably track its location.', 'Mobile Computing and Networking - MOBICOM'),

Unfortunately frequent location updates from multiple sinks can lead to both excessive drain of sensors'' limited battery power supply  and increased collisions in wireless transmissions. In this paper we describe TTDD, a Two-Tier Data Dissemination  approach that provides scalable and efficient data delivery to multiple mobile sinks. Each data source in TTDD proactively builds a grid structure which enables mobile sinks to continuously receive data on the move by flooding queries within a local cell only. TTDD''s design exploits the fact that sensor nodes  are stationary and location-aware to construct and maintain the grid structures with low overhead. We have evaluated TTDD performance through both analysis and extensive simulation experiments.

Since it is not necessary to maintain explicit routes, position-based routing does scale well even if the network is highly dynamic. This is a major advantage in a mobile ad hoc network  where the topology may change frequently. The main prerequisite for position-based routing is that a sender can obtain the current position of the destination.

Practical considerations such as the small size, form factor, cost and power constraints of nodes preclude the reliance on GPS of all nodes in these networks. We review localization techniques and evaluate the effectiveness of a very simple connectivity metric method for localization in outdoor environments that makes use of the inherent RF communications capabilities of these devices. A fixed number of reference points in the network with overlapping regions of coverage transmit periodic beacon signals. Nodes use a simple connectivity metric, which is more robust to environmental vagaries, to infer proximity to a given subset of these reference points. Nodes localize themselves to the centroid of their proximate reference points. The accuracy of localization is then dependent on the separation distance between two-adjacent reference points and the transmission range of these reference points.

These systems, especially the k-nearest neighbor collaborative filtering  based ones, are achieving widespread success on the Web. The tremendous growth in the amount of available information and the number of visitors to Web sites in recent years poses some key challenges for recommender systems. These are: producing high quality recommendations, performing many recommendations per second for millions of users and items and achieving high coverage in the face of data sparsity. In traditional collaborative filtering  systems the amount of work increases with the number of participants in the system. New recommender system  technologies are needed that can quickly produce high quality recommendations, even for very large-scale problems. To address these issues we have explored item-based collaborative filtering  techniques. Item- based techniques first analyze the user-item matrix to identify relationships between different items, and then use these relationships to indirectly compute recommendations for users. In this paper we analyze different item-based recommendation generation algorithms. We look into different techniques for computing item-item similarities (e.g., item-item correlation vs. cosine similarities between item vec- tors) and different techniques for obtaining recommendations from them (e.g., weighted sum vs. regression model). Finally, we experimentally evaluate our results and compare them to the basic k-nearest neighbor approach.

We present here SIMPLIcity (Semantics- sensitive Integrated Matching for Picture LIbraries), an image retrieval  system, which uses semantics classification methods, a wavelet-based approach for feature extraction, and integrated region matching based upon image segmentation. As in other region- based retrieval systems, an image is represented by a set of regions, roughly corresponding to objects, which are characterized by color, texture, shape, and location. The system classifies images into semantic categories, such as textured-nontextured, graph-photograph. Potentially, the categorization enhances retrieval by permitting semantically-adaptive searching methods and narrowing down the searching range in a database. A measure for the overall similarity between images is developed using a region-matching scheme that integrates properties of all the regions in the images. Compared with retrieval based on individual regions, the overall similarity approach 1) reduces the adverse effect  of inaccurate segmentation, 2) helps to clarify the semantics of a particular region, and 3) enables a simple querying interface for region-based image retrieval  systems. The application of SIMPLIcity to several databases, including a database of about 200,000 general-purpose images, has demonstrated that our system performs significantly better and faster than existing ones.

Consequences of this perspective are the recognition that certain systems are not AOP and that some mechanisms are expressive enough to allow programming an AOP system within them.

This metric essentially compares how many significant wavelet coefficients the query has in common with potential targets. The metric includes parameters that can be tuned, using a statistical analysis, to accommodate the kinds of image distortions found in different types of image queries.

These results can help information retrieval  researchers design experiments that provide a desired level of confidence in their results.

For the past decade, application-driven research on abiquitous computing (ubicomp) has pushed three interaction themes:natural interfaces, context-aware applications,and automated capture and access. To chart a course for future research in ubiquitous computing, we review the accomplishments of these efforts and point to remaining research challenges. Research in ubiquitious computing implicitly requires addressing some notion of scale, whether in the number and type of devices, the physical space of    distributed computing, or the number of people using a system. We posit a new area of applications research, everyday computing, focussed on scaling interaction with respect to time. Just as pushing the availiability of computing away from the traditional desktop fundamentally changes the relationship between humans and computers, providing continuous interaction moves computing from a localized tool to a constant companion. Designing for continous interaction requires addressing interruption and reumption of intreaction, representing passages of time and providing associative storage models. Inherent in all of these interaction themes are difficult issues in the social implications of ubiquitous computing  and the challenges of    evaluating> ubiquitious computing research.

Research on past tools has had enormous impact on today''s developers virtually all applications today are built using some form of user interface  tool. In this article, we consider cases of both success and failure in past user interface  tools. From these cases we extract a set of themes which can serve as lessons for future work. Using these themes, past tools can be characterized by what aspects of the user interface  they addressed, their threshold and ceiling, what path of least resistance they offer, how predictable they are to use, and whether they addressed a target that became irrelevant. We believe the lessons of these past themes are particularly important now, because increasingly  rapid technological changes are likely to significantly change user interfaces. We are at the dawn of an era where user interfaces are about to break out of the "desktop" box where they have been stuck for the past 15 years. The next millenium will open with an increasing diversity of user interface  on an increasing diversity of computerized devices. These devices include hand-held personal digital assistants (PDAs), cell phones, pages, computerized pens, computerized notepads, and various kinds of desk and wall size-computers, as well as devices in everyday objects (such as mounted on refridgerators, or even embedded in truck tires). The increased connectivity of computers, initially evidenced by the World Wide Web, but spreading also with technologies such as personal-area  networks, will also have a profound effect on the user interface  to computers. Another important force will be recognition-based user interfaces, especially speech, and camera-based vision systems.

Traditional clustering algorithms either favor clusters with spherical shapes and similar sizes, or are very fragile in the presence of outliers. We propose a new clustering algorithm called CURE that is more robust to outliers, and identifies clusters having non-spherical shapes and wide variances in size. CURE achieves this by representing each cluster by a certain fixed number of points that are generated by selecting well scattered points from the cluster and then shrinking them toward the center of the cluster by a specified fraction. Having more than one representative point per cluster allows CURE to adjust well to the geometry of non-spherical shapes and the shrinking helps to dampen the effects of outliers. To handle large databases, CURE employs a combination of random sampling  and partitioning. A random sample drawn from the data set is first partitioned and each partition is partially clustered. The partial clusters are then clustered in a second pass to yield the desired clusters. Our experimental results confirm that the quality of clusters produced by CURE is much better than those found by existing algorithms. Furthermore, they demonstrate that random sampling  and partitioning enable CURE to not only outperform existing algorithms but also to scale well for large databases without sacrificing clustering quality.', 'International Conference on Management of Data - SIGMOD'),

In traditional interactive computing, users have an impoverished mechanism for providing input to computers. By improving the computer''s access to context, we increase the richness of communication in human-computer interaction and make it possible to produce more useful computational services. The use of context is increasingly important in the fields of handheld and ubiquitous computing, where the user''s context is changing rapidly. In this panel, we want to discuss some of the research challenges in understanding context and in developing context-aware applications. We define context as any information that can be used to characterize the situation of an entity, where an entity can be a person, place, or physical or computational object. We define context-awareness or context-aware computing as the use of con-text to provide task-relevant information and/or services to a user. Three important context-awareness behaviours are the presentation of information and services to a user, automatic execution of a service, and tagging of context to information for later retrieval.

However, this potential requires development of viewpoint movement techniques that support rapid and controlled movement through workspaces. Rapid movement through large distances avoids wasted work time; controlled movement near target objects allows the user to examine and interact with objects in the workspace. Current techniques for viewpoint movement typically use high velocities to cover distances rapidly, but high velocities are hard to control near objects. This paper describes a new technique for targeted viewpoint movement that solves this problem. The key idea is to have the user indicate a point of interest  (target) on a 3D object and use the distance to this target to move the viewpoint logarithmically, by moving the same relative percentage of distance to the target on every animation cycle. the result is rapid motion over distances that slows as the viewpoint approaches the target object.

The algorithm is based on multidimensional scaling, a data analysis  technique that takes O(n3) time for a network of n nodes. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that the algorithm is more robust to measurement error  than previous proposals, especially when nodes are positioned relatively uniformly throughout the plane.

Morphogenetic randomness in the texture expressed phenotypically in the iris trabecular meshwork  ensures that a test of statistical independence  on two coded patterns originating from different eyes is passed almost certainly, whereas the same test is failed almost certainly when the compared codes originate from the same eye. The visible texture of a person''s iris in a real-time video image is encoded into a compact sequence of multi-scale quadrature 2-D Gabor wavelet coefficients, whose most-significant bits comprise a 256-byte "iris code."

However, cognitive walkthrough, heuristic evaluation, and thinking-aloud studies - three of the most widely used UEMs - suffer from a substantial evaluator effect in that multiple evaluators evaluating the same interface with the same UEM detect markedly different sets of problems. A review of eleven studies of these three UEMs reveals that the evaluator effect exists for both novice and experienced evaluators, for both cosmetic and severe problems, for both problem detection and severity assessment, and for evaluations of both simple and complex systems. The average agreement between any two evaluators who have evaluated the same system using the same UEM ranges from 5% to 65%, and no one of the three UEMs is consistently better than the others. While evaluator effects of this magnitude may not be surprising for a UEM as informal as heuristic evaluation, it is certainly notable that a substantial evaluator effect persists for evaluators who apply the strict procedure of cognitive walkthrough  or observe users thinking out loud. Hence, it is highly questionable to use a thinking -aloud study with one evaluator as an authoritative statement about what problems an interface contains. Generally, the application of the UEMs is characterised by (1) vague goal analyses leading to variability in the task scenarios, (2) vague evaluation procedures leading to anchoring, and/or (3) vague problem criteria leading to anything being accepted as a usability problem. The simplest way of coping with the evaluator effect, which cannot be completely eliminated, is to involve multiple evaluators in usability evaluations.', 'International Journal of Human-computer Interaction - IJHCI'),

Through history, a user can return quickly to a previously visited page, possibly reducing the cognitive and physical overhead required to navigate to it from scratch. We analysed 6 weeks of detailed usage data collected from 23 users of a well- known web browser. We found that 58% of an individual''s pages are revisits, and that users continually add new web pages  into their repertoire of visited pages. People tend to revisit pages just visited, access only a few pages frequently, browse in very small clusters of related pages and generate only short sequences of repeated URL paths. We compared dierent history mechanisms, and found that the stack-based prediction method  prevalent in commercial browsers is inferior to the simpler approach of showing the last few recently visited URLs with duplicates removed. Other predictive approaches fare even better. Based on empirical evidence, eight design guidelines for web browser history mechanisms were then formulated. When used to evaluate the existing hypertext-based history mechanisms, they explain why some aspects of today''s browsers seem to work well, and other''s poorly.

The Tic-Tac-Toe and its isomorphs are used to illustrate the procedures of the framework as a methodology and test the predictions of the framework as a functional model. Experimental results show that the behavior in the Tic-Tac-Toe is determined by the directly available information in external and internal representations in terms of perceptual and cognitive biases, regardless of whether the biases are consistent with, inconsistent with, or irrelevant to the task. It is shown that external representations are not merely inputs and stimuli to the internal mind and that they have much more important functions than mere memory aids. A representational determinism is suggested--the form of a representation determines what information can be perceived, what processes can be activated, and what structures can be discovered from the specific representation. External representations are involved in many cognitive tasks, such as multiplication with paper and pencil, grocery shopping with a written list, geometrical problem solving, graph understanding, diagrammatic reasoning, chess playing, and so on. Few would deny that external representations play certain roles in these tasks. However, in comparison with internal representations, relatively little research has been directed towards the nature of external representations in cognition. This might be due to the belief that very little knowledge about the internal mind can be gained by studying external representations, or due to the view that external representations are nothing but inputs and stimuli to the internal mind, or simply due to the lack of a suitable methodology for studying external representations. This article explores the functions of external representations, using problem solving  as the task domain and test bed. It takes the position that much can be learned about the internal mind by studying external representations because much of the structure of the internal mind is a reflection of the structure of the external environment (e.g., Anderson, 1993; Shepard, 1984; Simon, 1981). It argues that external representations are not simply inputs and stimuli to the internal mind; rather, they are so intrinsic to many cognitive tasks that they guide, constrain, and even determine cognitive behavior. By focusing on what information in external representations can be perceived and how the information in external representations affects problem solving  behavior, this article develops a theoretical framework  for external representation  based (henceforth, ER-based) problem solving. This framework is not only a functional model  that can make specific empirical predictions but also a methodology that can be used to systematically analyze ER-based problem solving  tasks. This article is divided into five parts. The first part introduces the theoretical background, including a definition of external representations, a discussion on the relationship between internal and external representations, and a brief review of the important roles of external representations in cognition. The second part proposes the theoretical framework  for ER-based problem solving. The third part uses the framework as a methodology to analyze the structure of the Tic- Tac-Toe and as a functional model  to make specific predictions about the behavior in the Tic-Tac-Toe. The fourth part reports three experiments designed to test the predictions of the framework and examine the general properties of external representations. The last part summarizes the experimental results, evalu- ates the theoretical framework, and suggests a representational determinism.', 'Cognitive Science - COGSCI'),

The basic principle of distributed representations is that the representational system of a distributed cognitive task is a set of internal and external representations, which together represent the abstract structure of the task. The basic strategy of representational analysis is to decompose the representation of a hierarchical task into its component levels so that the representational properties at each level can be independently examined. The theoretical framework  and the methodology are used to analyze the hi- erarchical structure of the Tower of Hanoi problem. Based on this analysis, four experiments are designed to examine the representational proper- ties of the Tower of Hanoi.

The results also show that the speed of performing the task was strongly correlated to the degree of parallelism employed. Experiment two involved the performance of a compound navigation/selection task. It compared a one-handed versus two-handed method for finding and selecting words in a document. The two-handed method significantly outperformed the commonly used one-handed method by a number of measures.

Results indicate that a large reduction in power consumption  can be achieved over current day solutions with little or no loss in system performance.', 'IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration Systems - VLSI'),

The algorithms which will be examined are the spatial gray level dependence method (SGLDM), the gray level run length method (GLRLM), the gray level difference method (GLDM), and the power spectral method  (PSM). The evaluation procedure employed does not depend on the set of features used with each algorithm or the pattern recognition  scheme. Rather, what is examined is the amount of texture context information contained in the spatial gray level dependence matrices, the gray level run length matrices, the gray level difference density functions, and the power spectrum. The comparison will be performed in two steps. First, only Markov generated textures will be considered. The Markov textures employed are similar to the ones used by perceptual psychologist B. Julesz in his investigations of human texture perception. These Markov textures provide a convenient mechanism for generating certain example texture pairs which are important in the analysis process. In the second part of the analysis the results obtained by considering only Markov textures will be extended to all textures which can be represented by translation stationary random fields of order two. This generalization clearly includes a much broader class of textures than Markovian ones. The results obtained indicate that the SGLDM is the most powerful algorithm of the four considered, and that the GLDM is more powerful than the PSM.', 'IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence - PAMI'),

This process can be tedious and is often done manually, since available commercial or in-house software usually can do only part of the job.To expedite this process, we introduce the Generic Mapping Tools  (GMT), which is a free, public domain software package  that can be used to manipulate columns of tabular data, time series, and gridded data sets and to display these data in a variety of forms ranging from simple x-y plots to maps and color, perspective, and shaded-relief illustrations. GMT uses the PostScript page description language, which can create arbitrarily complex images in gray tones or 24-bit true color by superimposing multiple plot files. Line drawings, bitmapped images, and text can be easily combined in one illustration. PostScript plot files are device-independent, meaning the same file can be printed at 300 dots per inch (dpi) on an ordinary laserwriter or at 2470 dpi on a phototypesetter when ultimate quality is needed.

MDS-MAP is a recent localization method based on multidimentional scaling (MDS). It uses connectivity information who is within communications range of whomto derive the locations of the nodes in the network, and can take advantage of additional data, such as estimated distances between neighbors or known positions for certain anchor nodes, if they are available. However, MDS- MAP is an inherently centralized algorithm and is there- fore of limited utility in many applications. In this paper, we present a new variant of the MDS-MAP method, which we call patched MDS-MAP, that can easily be executed in a distributed fashion. Using extensive simulations, we show that the new algorithm not only preserves the good performance of original method on relatively uniform layouts, but also performs much better than the original on irregularly- shaped networks. The main idea is to build a local map at each node of the immediate vicinity and then merge these maps together to form a global map. This approach works much better for topologies in which the shortest path  distance between two nodes does not correspond well to their Euclidean distance. We also discuss an optional refinement step that improves solution quality even further at the expense of additional computation.', 'IEEE INFOCOM - INFOCOM'),

A model is proposed that attempts to provide a systematic account of performance in highly compatible, incompatible, and noncompatible tasks. At the core of our model is the idea that when a particular S-R ensemble produces either high or low compatibility effects, it is because the stimulus and response sets in the ensemble have properties in common, and elements in the stimulus set automatically activate corresponding elements in the response set. Noncompatible tasks are those in which the stimulus and response sets have nothing in common. If the activated response is the required one, it will be executed rapidly and correctly; if it is not, then it will be relatively slow and error prone. Whether a particular S-R ensemble will produce compatibility effects is often quite easy to determine because of the relationship be- tween the stimulus and response sets. In the part of the model that treats the representational aspects of the problem, we postulate that this relationship is based on the commonality, similarity, or correspondence of the sets in the ensemble. We call this the dimensional overlap of the ensemble. The automatic response activation mechanisms, as well as the response identification processes underlying SRC effects, are the processing aspect of the model. Even though the model is still in its qualitative development phase, it is able to make ordinal predictions concerning several different SRC effects, such as the effects of mapping, irrelevant dimensions, and number of alternatives. These effects had been viewed as unrelated empirical phenomena, and most of the work on SRC has dealt with them as manifestations of unique, nongeneralizable properties of particular dimensions or specific tasks. This approach has led to different accounts being proposed for "spatial," "symbolic," "sensori-motor;'' and "semantic" tasks. Our model attempts to break with such past approaches in a fundamental way by proposing to account for most major SRC effects in terms of common basic cognitive mechanisms. This unitary approach leads to a taxonomy of SRC tasks that reveals striking similarities be- tween them and suggestive parallels with the experimental paradigms that have traditionally been used to investigate attentional, controlled, and automatic processes.', 'Psychological Review - PSYCHOL REV'),

We compare three distributed localization algorithms (Ad-hoc positioning, Robust positioning, and N -hop multilateration) on a single simulation platform.

We present a detailed analysis comparing the various alternatives for each phase, as well as a head-to-head comparison of the complete algorithms. The main conclusion is that no single algorithm performs best; which algorithm is to be preferred depends on the conditions (range errors, connectivity, anchor fraction, etc.).

We find that networks in these communities typically differ in their topology from other online networks such as the World Wide Web.

In this study, we analyze the Java Forum, a large online help-seeking community, using social network analysis  methods. We test a set of network-based ranking algorithms, including PageRank and HITS, on this large size social network  in order to identify users with high expertise. We then use simulations to identify a small number of simple simulation rules governing the question-answer dynamic in the network. These simple rules not only replicate the structural characteristics and algorithm performance on the empirically observed Java Forum, but also allow us to evaluate how other algorithms may perform in communities with different characteristics. We believe this approach will be fruitful for practical algorithm design  and implementation for online expertise-sharing communities.', 'World Wide Web Conference Series - WWW'),

It is based on a Markov-chain model of random walk  through the database. More precisely, we compute quantities (the average commute time, the pseudoinverse of the Laplacian matrix  of the graph, etc.) that provide similarities between any pair of nodes, having the nice property of increasing when the number of paths connecting those elements increases and when the "length" of paths decreases. It turns out that the square root of the average commute time is a Euclidean distance  and that the pseudoinverse of the Laplacian matrix  is a kernel matrix (its elements are inner products closely related to commute times). A principal component analysis  (PCA) of the graph is introduced for computing the subspace projection of the node vectors in a manner that preserves as much variance as possible in terms of the Euclidean commute-time distance. This graph PCA provides a nice interpretation to the "Fiedler vector," widely used for graph partitioning. The model is evaluated on a collaborative- recommendation task where suggestions are made about which movies people should watch based upon what they watched in the past. Experimental results on the MovieLens database show that the Laplacian-based similarities perform well in comparison with other methods. The model, which nicely fits into the so-called "statistical relational learning" framework, could also be used to compute document or word similarities, and, more generally, it could be applied to machine-learning and pattern-recognition tasks involving a relational database.', 'IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering - TKDE'),

This allows for a direct comparison of all features considered in this work and furthermore will allow a comparison of newly proposed features to these in the future. Additionally, the correlation of the features is analysed, which opens the way for a simple and intuitive method to find an initial set of suitable features for a new task.
